3. Write examples for increment and decrement operators

answer:		

There are 2 types in increment operator

pre-increment operator:		int a=6;
				int b=6;
				b=++a;
				here the value of 'a' is incremented first and then assigned to 'b'
				hence b=7 , a=7

post-increment operator:	int a=6;
				int b=6;
				b=a++;
				here the value of 'b' is changed to 'a' and later 'a' is incremented
				hence b=6 , a=7



There are 2 types in decrement operator

pre-decrement operator:		int a=6;
				int b=6;
				b=--a;
				here the value of 'a' is decremented first and then assigned to 'b'
				hence b=5 , a=5

post-decrement operator:	int a=6;
				int b=6;
				b=a--;
				here the value of 'b' is changed to 'a' and later 'a' is decremented
				hence b=6 , a=5
