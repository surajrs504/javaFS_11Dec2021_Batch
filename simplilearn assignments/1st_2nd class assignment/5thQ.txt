5. Write the concepts discussed about strings in the class.


String are immutable which means they are unmodifiable, once the string is created, it cannot be changed 
ie if a String is changed it will create entirely new string
but if we explicitly assign it to a reference variable it will refer to a new object in which the change has taken place.

String datatype starts with a capital 'S' whereas other datatype start with a smaller case letter since its a 
class and not a primitive datatype.
